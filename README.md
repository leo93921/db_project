# Job Analytics
A project done for a university exam.

In this project we have done:
- connection on three job posting sites with scraping of the offers;
- adaptation of the data extracted from the scraping and adaptation to a standard form;
- exposure of REST web API to be called from the front-end project.

The project is for demonstration purposes, as the whole project is bigger.
